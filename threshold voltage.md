threshold voltage is defined as the gate-source voltage at which the number of electrons pulled to the surface equals the number of doping atoms.
It is calculated using the formula mentioned below-
$$
V_t = V_{to} + \gamma \left( \sqrt{2\phi_F + V_{sb}} - \sqrt{2\phi_F} \right)
$$
---Vth(threshold voltage) is also defined as the V<sub>GS</sub>  at which the number of electrons pulled to the surface equals the number of doping atoms

--- V<sub>GS</sub> = Vth i.e.  V<sub>GSeff</sub>  =0 , the mobile charges in the channel becomes the linear function of 
V<sub>GSeff</sub> 

--- However there is a mobile charges present in the channel even before V<sub>GS</sub> reaches Vth and the current due to diffusion of charge carriers is called diffusion current.
