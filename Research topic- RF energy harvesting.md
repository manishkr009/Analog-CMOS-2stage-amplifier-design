-RF(using GaN transistor) signal trapping in the frequency range of 30 to 300GHz 
--- Rf signal is captured using the receiver antenna and then signal is rectified to generate DC which is boosted using the chopper circuit and using the voltage regulator and a thin capacitor battery is charged and microcontroller is used to check the output voltage. 

##Reason for choosing the above frequency range
--- The lower frequency signal(FM and radio) have low power so can't generate the desired voltage to power electronic devices.

--- The frequency upto 5GHz is already explored (IOT, Wifi and bluetooth) these devices uses frequency in this range.

--- The remaining frequency range Satellite Communication Bands (1 GHz to 10 GHz).Frequencies used for satellite communications, such as the **Ku-band (12–18 GHz)** and **Ka-band (26.5–40 GHz)**, are still not fully explored. These bands could offer potential for RF energy harvesting in specialized environments like space or remote areas, but current research hasn't focused on these high-frequency bands for powering everyday electronic devices.

### **Millimeter-Wave Frequencies (Above 30 GHz)**

- **mmWave Bands**: Frequencies in the **30 GHz to 300 GHz range**, which include the newer **5G millimeter-wave bands**, are relatively untapped for energy harvesting. These higher frequencies could offer significant potential in dense urban environments with abundant mmWave signals, but challenges like **signal attenuation** and **device miniaturization** are barriers to practical energy harvesting in this spectrum.

---What can we do now?
--- - we can focus on the V band( frequency range)
