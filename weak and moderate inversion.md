--- weak to moderate inversion have a criteria as 0< V<sub>GSeff</sub> < 150mV where is V<sub>GSeff</sub>  is equal to
V<sub>GS</sub> - V<sub>T</sub> 

--- This region consist of both MOS and Bipolar type currents i.e. diffusion and drift current both.

if I<sub>drift</sub> / I<sub>diffusion</sub> = (V<sub>GS</sub> - Vth)/kT/q == I<sub>drift</sub> will be more dominant for V<sub>GSeff</sub> = "several"kT/q
