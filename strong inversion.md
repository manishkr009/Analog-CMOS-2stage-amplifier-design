--- weak to moderate inversion have a criteria as V<sub>GSeff</sub> > 150mV where is V<sub>GSeff</sub>  is equal to
V<sub>GS</sub> - V<sub>T</sub> 
--- Also we know our square law model and simulation results are mostly comparable in strong inversion region.
### Issues with strong inversion region
- Short channel effects
- velocity saturation
- mobility degradation
- Threshold voltage as function of width and length of transistor
- Threshold voltage as function of drain to source voltage
- drain to source resistance as function of drain to source voltage
