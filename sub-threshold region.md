--- weak to moderate inversion have a criteria as V<sub>GSeff</sub> < 0 where is V<sub>GSeff</sub>  is equal to
V<sub>GS</sub> - V<sub>T</sub> 

---In the sub-threshold region the current is due to diffusion and thus called diffusion current.

--- I<sub>D</sub> =I<sub>0</sub> e<sup>(Vgs-Vth)/nkT/q)</sup> 
and gm= change in I<sub>D</sub> /change in V<sub>GS</sub>  and gm/I<sub>D</sub> = q/nkT
