The purpose of miller capacitor is to change the 2-stage amplifier into first order system by shifting the pole associated with node 1 to low frequencies and the pole associated with node 2 beyond the transition frequency.
- If a capacitor is connected between two nodes whose node voltages are not 0 then the capacitance seen from input will be (1-A<sub>v</sub>)* Cm and 
   -capacitance seen by output will be (1-1/A<sub>v</sub>)* Cm

# Pole splitting 
Suppose the gain bandwidth product is equal to 50MHz. The pole associated to the high impedance nodes1 and 2 respectively gd1/c1 and gd2/c2 determine the cut -off frequency respectively equal to 1.99 MHz and 3.06MHz. The amplifier is thus clearly a second order system since both pole lies well below the transit frequency. The purpose of miller capacitor is to split these poles apart, pushing one beyond f<sub>T</sub> , the other to much lower frequencies.
